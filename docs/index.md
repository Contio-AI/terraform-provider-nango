# nango Provider

The Nango provider allows you to manage [Nango](https://www.nango.dev/) integrations as infrastructure as code. Nango is a unified API platform that simplifies integrations with third-party services by providing pre-built connectors and OAuth management.

Use the Nango provider to:

- **Manage Integrations**: Create, read, update, and delete Nango integrations
- **Configure OAuth**: Set up OAuth2 credentials and scopes for various third-party providers
- **Query Existing Resources**: Use data sources to retrieve information about existing integrations

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    nango = {
      source  = "contio.ai/contio/nango"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "nango" {
  environment_key = "your-nango-environment-key"
}

# Create a Google OAuth integration
resource "nango_integration" "google" {
  unique_key     = "google-oauth"
  display_name   = "Google OAuth"
  nango_provider = "google"

  credentials = {
    client_id     = var.google_client_id
    client_secret = var.google_client_secret
    type          = "OAUTH2"
    scopes = [
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile"
    ]
  }
}

# Query all existing integrations
data "nango_integrations" "all" {}
```

## Authentication

The Nango provider requires an environment key to authenticate with the Nango API. You can obtain this key from your Nango dashboard.

### Environment Key

The environment key can be provided in two ways:

1. **Provider Configuration** (recommended for most use cases):
   ```terraform
   provider "nango" {
     environment_key = "your-nango-environment-key"
   }
   ```

2. **Environment Variable**:
   ```bash
   export NANGO_ENVIRONMENT_KEY="your-nango-environment-key"
   ```

-> **Note:** When both are provided, the provider configuration takes precedence over the environment variable.
